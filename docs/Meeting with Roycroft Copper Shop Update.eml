Hi Joan,
 
I met with Christine Peters and two  others at the Roycroft Copper  Shop 
today. The meeting went very well. Here is what we agreed upon.
 
1.    The Roycroft Copper Shop will sell RCMF tickets  for the first time.  
They will be listed on our poster, and we will give  them an ad in our 
program.
 
2.    There will be a link placed on our website, to  direct people to the 
Copper Shop's website where tickets can be purchased (once  we have them). I 
will go over daily and pick up the names and numbers and  addresses of 
people who have paid for tickets so that I can send them out.
 
3.    Selling tickets at the door is a bit more  challenging because of the 
line that forms and the need to get the correct  information. If we can 
work this out, that's great, but if it becomes overly  cumbersome, then we 
won't do it.  In any case, we can certainly encourage  people to use the credit 
card option for advance sale (at a cost of  approximately 
$0.02/transaction). For door transactions that have to be entered  manually (which is all of 
them), the cost will be closer to $0.20/transaction). 
 
4.    The Copper Shop can accept Visa, MasterCard, AmEx  and Discover, 
although the cost for each may vary. We have agreed to pay  whatever costs are 
associated with our sales.
