			<td valign="top">Violinist and Artistic Director Nancy McFarland Gaub, and her husband, Eugene Gaub, were East Aurora residents when they founded the RCMF in 1994. Then a member of the first violin section of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, she was a frequent soloist and chamber musician in the Buffalo area. The Buffalo News called her performance of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with the BPO “the highlight of the evening,” and her performance of Vivaldi’s St. Anthone Concert, “superb.” Ms. McFarland Gaub received degrees from Chicago Musical College of Roosevelt University and the Juilliard School, where she was a scholarship student of Dorothy Delay. Her other teachers included Raymond Niwa, William Lincer, Paul Winter, members of the Juilliard String Quartet, Karl Fruh, and Adia Ghertovic.

<p>Ms. McFarland Gaub has performed at the Aspen, Spoleto (Italy), Chautauqua, Stowe, Adirondack, Grant Park Symphony, and Eastern Music Festivals, and at the Festival de Invierno in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. She is now a lecturer and Artist in Residence at Grinnell College, in Grinnell, Iowa. Her violin was made by Giovanni Grancino of Milan in 1695.</td>
