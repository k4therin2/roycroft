			<td valign="top">Amy Glidden is currently the associate concertmaster of the Buffalo Philharmonic, a position she has held since 2000. A native of Wichita, Kansas, Amy attended the University of Kansas, where she received a B.A. in Biology as well as a B.M. in Violin Performance. Subsequently, she received a Master of Violin Performance degree from the Cleveland Institute of Music. Her major teachers include Ben Sayevich, Eric Rosenblith, and Linda Cerone.

<p>Prior to her appointment to the Buffalo Philharmonic, Amy had extensive orchestral experience.  She has performed with the Toronto Symphony, the Hamilton Philharmonic, and the Canadian National Ballet Orchestra. While a resident of San Francisco, Amy served as assistant concertmaster of the Marin Symphony and concertmaster of the Mendocino Music Festival. In addition to her duties with the Buffalo Philharmonic, Amy travels to Sun Valley, Idaho each summer to perform with the Sun Valley Summer Symphony. She has also participated in the Grand Teton Music Festival. 

<p>Amy made her solo debut with the Buffalo Philharmonic in Bach’s <em>Brandenburg Concerto No. 2</em> in 2000, followed by two performances of the Chausson <em>Poeme<em> for Violin and Orchestra in 2003. Other solo engagements include performances with the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra, the Mendocino Music Festival, the Marin Symphony, and, locally, the Ars Nova Chamber Orchestra.  In April 2006, she will perform Mozart’s <em>Concerto No. 5</em> with the Buffalo Philharmonic.

<p>As do most orchestral musicians, Amy finds great enjoyment and musical satisfaction in performing chamber music. She is a member of the Clara String Quartet, comprised of BPO musicians, which has performed on many chamber music venues in Buffalo. The Clara String Quartet strives to provide the Buffalo audience with the highest level of performance possible in a variety of settings, including performing as soloists with the Buffalo Philharmonic, accompanying the Buffalo Gay Men’s Chorus, and bringing string quartet music to Nietzsche’s in Allentown. In addition, Amy periodically returns to her hometown of Wichita, Kansas to collaborate in the “Chamber Music in the Barn” series. Besides maintaining a private violin studio, Amy is a  Suzuki violin instructor and teaches at Orchard Park Suzuki Strings.
