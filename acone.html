			<td valign="top">A member of the Buffalo Philharmonic since 1987, violinist Andrea Blanchard Cone is an active performer in chamber music and solo recitals.  She has soloed with the BPO on numerous occasions performing works of Sarasate, Mozart, Svendson, and Saint Saens.   Also a member of Ars Nova for many years, she had many opportunities to solo during its well-known Viva Vivaldi festival.

A graduate of the Eastman School of Music, Andrea studied with Sylvia Rosenberg.  While still a student at Eastman, she was offered a part-time contract with the Rochester Philharmonic, then under the direction of David Zinman.  She also played in Alexander Schneider’s New York String Orchestra Seminar in 1984. After joining the BPO, she taught violin at the University of Buffalo as an adjunct professor from 1989-1997. 

Andrea currently lives in Williamsville with her husband Doug, also a violinist with the BPO, and their two young children, Drew and Matt.
